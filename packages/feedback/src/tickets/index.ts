// @boring/feedback/tickets (FEEDBACK.md, "Tickets"), server only: a ticket is a Markdown file the assistant writes under `tickets/` with
// Pi's own file tools; `createTicketSinks(...).mirror(path)`, called by the host when a write creates one, publishes it once to the first
// sink that accepts the project and writes the outcome back into its front matter. Imports `@boring/files` contracts (type-only) and nothing else.
