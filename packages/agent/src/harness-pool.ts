/*
 * One harness per owner, for hosts that prefer isolation to one shared harness with per-call workspaces
 * (`@boring/agent/workspaces`). The pool opens an owner's harness on first use, routes each operation to it, and closes it once
 * nothing holds it, it has no live task or unsettled submission, and it has been idle for `idleMs`. It shares nothing between
 * owners: every owner's harness, storage, registry and environment come from the host's `create(owner)`.
 *
 * Choose one shared harness with per-call resolution when many people use the same agent and the host wants one storage, one
 * scheduler and one recovery pass; choose the pool when each owner needs its own storage file (a single-writer SQLite per person,
 * an AgentCore session per conversation key), its own registry (a self-evolving agent installs per-workspace extensions), or
 * crash isolation between owners.
