 * keyed by the tool call ID, answered with `answerUserQuestion` over the chat transport's `answer` operation, shown by
 * pi-chat's approval card). The check runs in host code inside the tool's own execution, so the model cannot skip it.
 *
 * - While it waits, the summary is published as running details under `APPROVAL_DETAILS` for the card.
 * - Deny returns an error result starting `DENIED_PREFIX` and `execute` never runs. A question cancelled while the call
 *   itself keeps running returns one starting `CANCELLED_PREFIX`; when the call is being stopped, Pi records the stop.
 * - A pending approval survives a restart: the wrapper is replay-safe, and replay re-attaches to the stored question.
 * - Execution happens at most once per call. The wrapper retains a native memo before running the inner tool; if the
 *   process dies after that and the inner tool is not itself `replay: 'safe'`, recovery returns an error saying the
 *   outcome is unknown instead of repeating a change that may have happened.
 *
 * Code mode: gated tools are native tools. Do not expose them to a code-mode sandbox (its nested calls cannot reach a
 * person), and filter with `isApprovalGated`. Give `run_code` the read tools only; changes go through the gated native tool.
