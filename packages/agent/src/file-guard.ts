/*
 * The guard for Pi's own `read`, `write` and `edit`. It adds no tool and no file API: it wraps the native tools (public
 * `wrapTool`) so that the agent cannot overwrite what it has not seen.
 *
 *  - Every wrapped call runs inside the workspace provider's mutation queue, so a viewer save cannot land between `edit`'s
 *    internal read and its write.
 *  - A genuine `read` call records the file's revision (the provider's Git blob id of the bytes) as this conversation's
 *    last-read revision of the path, in a native conversation document: it survives restarts. `edit`'s internal read is not
 *    a `read` call and never records anything.
 *  - `write` and `edit` of a file that exists are refused unless the conversation read it and its revision still equals the
 *    last-read one. Creating a file is allowed only while it is absent. After a successful `write` or `edit` the baseline is
 *    the revision just written.
 *
 * Pi's `edit` matches `oldText` exactly first and only then falls back to a fuzzy match (Unicode normalisation, trailing
 * whitespace, smart quotes, dashes and special spaces); that is Pi's behaviour and the guard does not change it. A shell write
 * (`bash`) is not intercepted, but it changes the revision, so the next `write` or `edit` of that file is refused until read.
 *
 * The workspace is resolved per call, like Pi's environment (`@boring/agent/workspaces`): one guard serves every conversation of
 * a harness, each in its own workspace. Baselines are keyed by the workspace identity and the path.
