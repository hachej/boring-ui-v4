/*
 * The workspace of a call, resolved like Pi's environment. Pi builds a conversation's `ExecutionEnv` at each use from
 * `HarnessOptions.env(target, context)`; the workspace tools (the file guard, `present`, the canvas tools) resolve their
 * workspace provider the same way, from the same target, instead of closing over one provider when they are created. One
 * harness can then serve several people, each conversation working in its own workspace.
 *
 * Coherence: the env Pi hands a call and the provider a tool resolves must be the same workspace instance. `createWorkspaceCache`
 * keeps both in one entry per workspace key, so `cache.env` (given to Pi) and `cache.workspace` (given to the tools) agree, and a
 * binding names its env so that a tool refuses a call whose env is another instance (the entry was closed and reopened between
 * the two lookups). A host with one workspace passes `constantWorkspace({ files, root })`.
 *
 * One host function: a host that opens its workspaces with `createWorkspaceCache` (or attaches a binding to an env with
 * `withWorkspace`) gives the harness `env` and nothing else. A tool created without a `workspace` option resolves the binding of
 * the env Pi handed its call (`api.env`), so the workspace of a call is, by construction, the one its env belongs to.
