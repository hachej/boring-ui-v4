// Host code, not a package API: one SQLite database holding one workspace per scope. Each scope's files are rows of its own
// workspace (`openSqliteFileSystem`), served by its own workspace provider; the journal (receipts, intents, history) lives in the
// same database, keyed by each workspace's identity, so a multi-file save and its receipt commit in one transaction.
//
// Access control is at the workspace boundary and belongs to the host ([One place for files](../../docs/architecture/FILES-GIT-EXEC.md#one-place-for-files)):
// `authorize(action, target, access)` is the host's policy, checked here before a request reaches the scope's workspace. A
// refused write whose operation already committed reads `unknown`, and a lookup the policy no longer permits reads `unknown`,
// so a revoked caller never learns a receipt and never mistakes a committed operation for one that did not happen.
