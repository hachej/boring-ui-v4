A fictional trail report for an invented circuit that starts and ends at Placeholder Pier.

## Route

Follow the cliff path to Example Cove, climb the stepped ridge, then return along the old tram line. The loop is about nine kilometres.

## Conditions

The path is dry and well marked. Expect a light breeze on the ridge and fog in the early morning.

## Timing

Allow three hours at an easy pace, plus a break at the Invented Inn.
