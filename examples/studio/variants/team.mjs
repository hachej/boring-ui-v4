// Variant `team`: ONE agent on the studio's one harness, used by several fictional people, each in their own workspace. Nothing about
// the agent is per person: its file guard, `present`, canvas tools, bash, working_git and self-evolution take the workspace of each
// call from the env Pi resolved for it (`@boring/agent/workspaces`: the cache attaches each person's workspace to that person's env),
// from the person who owns the conversation. The viewers (file tree, file viewer, uploads, resources, Git tab, `/reload`) resolve the
// same workspace from the authenticated request. Workspaces open on first use and close when idle.
//
// Where the files live: one SQLite file in the data directory, one workspace (file system + journal) per person in it, with just-bash
// over the same rows, like the Cloudflare recipe. Each person's workspace is also their own git repository (isomorphic-git over the
// same file system, `createEnvGitFs`), and holds their agent's own `.agent/` (self-evolution: the extension `self-evolving:team-<person>`,
// selected only by that person's conversations). The harbour MCP server is reached with each person's own fictional credential.
